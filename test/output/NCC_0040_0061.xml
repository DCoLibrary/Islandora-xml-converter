  <abstract>Moore photographed this police officer standing vigil over a deserted Main Street during the curfew following the assassination of Martin Luther King in Memphis.  He also photographed firebombings of several Durham businesses that led to the curfew.  \"The '60s were probably the best time for photojournalism,\" Moore said.  \"You didn't feel safe at times, but you knew you needed to be there.\"</abstract>
