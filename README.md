![GUI Interface](https://github.com/gigafide/Islandora-xml-converter/blob/main/images/screenshot.PNG)

This script is based on the work of **[@calhist](https://github.com/calhist)** and their **(XML Splitter)(https://github.com/calhist/xml_splitter)** python script.
It takes OpenRefine XML ouput and breaks it down into individual XML files for use in programs like [Islandora](https://www.islandora.ca/).
This specific version of the script updates to Python 3 and adds a Tkinter GUI and file browser to streamline the converstion process.
