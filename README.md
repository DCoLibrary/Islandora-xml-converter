# OpenRefine XML Convert
### A tool for converting OpenRefine XML to individual XML files for use in programs like Islandora 
This script is based on the work of [calhist](https://github.com/calhist).
It takes OpenRefine XML ouput and breks it down into individual XML files for use in programs like [Islandora](https://www.islandora.ca/).
This specific version of the script updates to Python 3 and adds a Tkinter GUI and file browser to streamline the converstion process.
